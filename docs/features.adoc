= Features

This section describes the main features of Allure.
For example, you can group your tests by stories or features, attach files, and distribute assertions over a
set of custom steps, among other features. All features are supported by Java test frameworks, so we only provide
Java examples here. For details on how a particular adapter works with the test framework of your choice,
refer to the adapter guide.
