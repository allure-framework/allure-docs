= Get Started

To generate your first report you will need to go through just a few simple steps:

 * Downloading and installing Allure commandline application suitable for your environment.
 * Locating test execution data that you have to build a report on.

== Installing a commandline
Several options for Allure installation are currently supported:

=== Linux
For debian-based repositories a PPA is provided:
[source, bash]
----
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:qameta/allure
sudo apt-get updateÂ 
sudo apt-get install allure
----

=== Mac OS X
For Mas OS, automated installation is available via link:https://brew.sh[Homebrew]
[source, bash]
----
brew install allure
----

=== Windows

For Windows, Allure is available from the link:http://scoop.sh/[Scoop] commandline-installer.

To install Allure, download and install Scoop and then execute in the Powershell:

[source, powershell]
----
scoop install allure
----

Also Scoop is capable of updating Allure distribution installations. To do so navigate to the Scoop installation
directory and execute

[source, powershell]
----
\bin\checkver.ps1 allure -u
----

This will check for newer versions of Allure, and update the manifest file. Then execute

[source, powershell]
----
scoop update allure
----

to install a newer version. (link:https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/wiki/App-Manifest-Autoupdate[documentation])

=== Manual installation

. Download the latest version as zip archive from link:http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/qameta/allure/allure-commandline/[Maven Central].
. Unpack the archive to allure-commandline directory.
. Navigate to *bin* directory.
. Use *allure.bat* for Windows or *allure* for other Unix platforms.
. Add **allure** to system PATH.

[WARNING]
====
To run commandline application, Java Runtime Environment must be installed.
====

NOTE: Older releases (<= 2.8.0) are available on link:https://bintray.com/qameta/generic/allure2[bintray].

=== Check the installation
Execute `allure --version` in console to make sure that allure is now available:
[source, bash]
----
$ allure --version
2.0.1
----

== Test execution

Before building a report you need to run your tests to obtain some basic test report data.
Typically it might be a junit-style xml report generated by nearly every popular test framework.
For example, suppose you have test reports automatically created by surefire maven plugin
stored in the `target/surefire-reports`:

== Report generation

This is already enough to see the Allure report in one command:

`allure serve /home/path/to/project/target/surefire-reports/`

Which generates a report in temporary folder from the data found in the provided path
and then creates a local Jetty server instance, serves generated report and opens it in the default browser.
It is possible to use a *--profile* option to enable some pre-configured allure setting. *junit* profile is enabled
by default, you will learn more about profiles in the following <<_commandline,section>>.

This would produce a report with a minimum of information extracted from the xml data that will lack nearly all
 of the advanced allure features but will allow you to get a nice visual representation of executed tests.
