= Report structure

Once you've got the idea what the report does look like. You will probably want to get more data-rich reports.
You might have to consider using one of the Allure adaptors for your testing framework, which will allow to collect
much more information. Jump to the integrations section to learn more about integration with testing frameworks.

Typical report consists of 'Overview' tab, navigation bar, several tabs for different kinds of
test data representation and test case pages for each individual test.
Each Allure report is backed by a tree-like data structure, that represents a test execution process. Different tabs
allow to switch between the views of the original data structure thus giving a different perspective.
Note that all tree-like representations including Behaviors, Categories, xUnit and Packages support filtering and
are sortable.

== Overview page

Entry point for every report would be the 'Overview' page with dashboards and widgets:

Overview page hosts several default widgets representing basic characteristics of your project and test environment.

 * Statistics - overall report statistics.
 * Launches - if this report represents several test launches, statistics per launch will be shown here.
 * Behaviors - information on results aggregated according to stories and features.
 * Executors - information on test executors that were used to run the tests.
 * History Trend - if tests accumulated some historical data, it's trend will be calculated and shown on the graph.
 * Environment - information on test environment (see link:#_environment[how to define environment]).

Home page widgets are draggable and configurable. Also, Allure supports it's own plugin system, so quite different
 widget layouts are possible.

Navigation bar is collapsible and enables you to switch into several of the basic results overview modes.

== Categories

Categories tab gives you the way to link:#_categories_2[create custom defects classification] to apply for test results.

== Suites

On the Suites tab a standard structural representation of executed tests, grouped by suites and classes can be found.

== Graphs

Graphs allow you to see different statistics collected from the test data: statuses breakdown or
severity and duration diagrams.

== Timeline

Timeline tab visualizes retrospective of tests execution, allure adaptors collect precise timings of tests,
and here on this tab they are arranged accordingly to their sequential or parallel timing structure.

== Behaviors

For Behavior-driven approach, this tab groups test results according to Epic, Feature and Story tags.

== Packages

Packages tab represents a tree-like layout of test results, grouped by different packages.

== Test case page

From some of the results overview pages described above you can go to the test case page after clicking on the
individual tests. This page will typically contain a lot of individual data related to the test case: steps
executed during the test, timings, attachments, test categorization labels, descriptions and links.
