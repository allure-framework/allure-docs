= Codefresh

== Configuration

Codefresh stores all Allure reports in cloud storage. Current integrations exist for Google Cloud
and AWS buckets.

First go to your Account Configuration, by clicking on Account Settings on the left sidebar. On the first section called Integrations scroll down to Cloud Storage:

Click the configure button and in the following screen enter your cloud settings according to your cloud provider.
Make sure that you note down your bucket name as it will be used later in the pipeline definition.


== Usage

Codefresh offers a plugin that can create your reports. The link:https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/freestyle/[plugin] is just inserted on any link:https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/codefresh-yaml/what-is-the-codefresh-yaml/[Codefresh pipeline]
and by default looks for test results in `allure-results`.

[source, yaml]
----
 my_unit_test_reporting_step:
   title: Generate test reporting
   image: codefresh/cf-docker-test-reporting
   environment:
     - BUCKET_NAME=my-bucket-name
     - CF_STORAGE_INTEGRATION=google
----

If you are using a different directory for holding the Allure results you must specify it with the `ALLURE_DIR` environment variable.

[source, yaml]
----
 my_unit_test_reporting_step:
   title: Generate test reporting
   image: codefresh/cf-docker-test-reporting
   working_directory: './my-git-project'
   environment:
     - BUCKET_NAME=my-bucket-name
     - ALLURE_DIR=my-custom-allure-results-folder
     - CF_STORAGE_INTEGRATION=google
----

Once you run your pipeline a new *Test report* button will appear next to each build. Click on it and you will see your Allure reports.

== Historical Test data

Codefresh will automatically keep the results from your previous builds in the cloud storage. There is no configuration needed for this behavior. You will see historical trends in your Allure results as you run more builds.
