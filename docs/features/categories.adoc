= Categories

There are two categories of defects by default:

 * Product defects (failed tests)
 * Test defects (broken tests)

To create custom defects classification add `categories.json` file to `allure-results` directory before report generation.

.categories.json
[source, json]
----
[
  {
    "name": "Ignored tests", <1>
    "matchedStatuses": ["skipped"] <2>
  },
  {
    "name": "Infrastructure problems",
    "matchedStatuses": ["broken", "failed"]
    "messageRegex": ".*bye-bye.*", <3>
  },
  {
    "name": "Outdated tests",
    "matchedStatuses": ["broken"]
    "traceRegex": ".*FileNotFoundException.*", <4>
  },
  {
    "name": "Product defects",
    "matchedStatuses": ["failed"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Test defects",
    "matchedStatuses": ["broken"]
  }
]
----
<1> (mandatory) category name
<2> (optional) list of suitable test statuses. Default `["failed", "broken", "passed", "skipped", "unknown"]`
<3> (optional) regex pattern to check test error message. Default `".*"`
<3> (optional) regex pattern to check stack trace. Default `".*"`

Test result falls into the category if its status is in the list and both error message and stack trace match the pattern.

NOTE: `categories.json` file can be stored in test resources directory in case of using link:#_maven_5[allure-maven] or link:#_gradle_4[allure-gradle] plugins.
