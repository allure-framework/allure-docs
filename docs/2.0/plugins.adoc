== Allure Plugins System

Allure is designed to be highly customizable, because practice shows that many teams across the world
may have different metrics, or may have developed unique approaches for testing, their products might demand
something completely different to the initial requirements Allure was built to comply. To deal with this
kinds of challenges Allure has a plugin system, that gives a lot of flexibility to the report representation.

To be precise, all of the basic functionality is modularized into plugins, and it would be too lengthy to list
them all here. But nearly every feature described in the features section [link to allure features section]
 is implemented internally as a plugin.

=== Java Plugin API overview

Let's take a look into the class diagram of the top classes in the Allure plugins system.

image::plugins_api_uml_diagram.png[Top interfaces hierarchy]

Plugin classes can extend 3 basic interfaces that provide different aspects of functionality:

 * *Reader* allows to implement a `readResults` method, which defines the logic of reading results with `ResultsVisitor`
 instance from the directory with test results.
 * *Aggregator* allows to implement `aggregate` method, which defines the logic of aggregating processed results across
 all the results folders, and write resulting data to the report directory.
 * *Widget* this interface allows to implement `getData` method which again defines the logic of processed results aggregation
 but this time resulting data is saved into the `widget.json` file to be used by the widget named accordingly to the value
 supplied in `getName`.
 * *Context<T>* interface with `T getValue()` method enables to create some utility class to be used for all
 plugins via a method `Configuration.requireContext(Class<T>)` available from a Configuration instance, provided as
 a parameter in all of the 3 methods above.

=== JS Plugin API overview

Front-end side of the Allure is built using link:http://backbonejs.org/[BackboneJS] framework. So some basic
understanding of it's internal mechanisms may sometimes be necessary.

Api is accessible from the `allure.api` global object. Let's take a look at the list of functions it provides:

* `addTab(tabName, {title, icon, route, onEnter = notFound} = {})` - can be used to define a new tab for the report
which will appear on the left pane menu with name *tabName*, it's icon will be defined by a css styles provided
in the *icon* string, *route* will define an address for a new tab page. *onEnter* should be a function, that
instantiates a View class managing your new tab's representation.

* `addTranslation(lang, json)` - gives you an ability to support multiple languages for naming in tabs, widgets or
test case blocks you've created. *lang* is a language key, and *json* is a json object that contains mappings for string
values in the specified language.

* `translate(name, options)` - is needed if you generate html code in your plugin and don't use existing components,
provided in `allure.components`. In the tab example above you have to wrap strings in the template in this function call
to enable string translation to be picked up from the global registry.
See more in the docs for link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18next-text[i18next].

* `addWidget(name, Widget)` - is a way to create a new widget on the Overview page of the report. *name* will define
it's displayed name, and *Widget* is a `View` to be added to the widgets grid.
Api provides you with a base class for a widget at `allure.components.WidgetStatusView`, which we will examine
later in the Behaviors plugin section. But you may design a widget for your own needs extending from
`Backbone.Marionette.View`, just keep in mind that this widget definition is designed to pop up the data
to fill the Model for this View from the `widgets.json` file, by the key you supplied in *name* parameter.

* `addTestcaseBlock(view, {position})` - allows to add a View class to the Test Case page, in the one of 3 possible
block groups, determined by a *position* argument. Position can be one of this values: `tag`, `after` or `before`.
To understand what kind of information you may attach to the test case page, jump to the section with related
features [jump to the features list]

=== Writing a skeleton code for a new plugin.

Here we will cover the steps that it usually takes to build a new plugin.

==== Step 1: Create a new plugin project

*Plugin structure*

Basically, any plugin will be constituted of two main parts:

* *Java classes* that process the report data and produce some results in the report folder.
* *JS script* that takes stored results and creates a representation for them on the report's front-end side,
e.g. a widget or an additional tab.

Typical structure of a plugin module would look like this:

[source]
----
/my-plugin
    /src
        /dist
            /static
            allure-plugin.yml
        /main
            /java
                /my.company.plugin
    build.gradle
----

Here in `src\dist\static` all the static `.js` and `.css` files are stored, and everything under `src\main\java`
is a data processing Java code. `allure-plugin.yml` - is a configuration file.

*Contents of allure-plugin.yml file*

This file contains directives in human-readable format that plugin loader will further use to locate resources
 and connect the plugin.

[[app-listing]]
[source, yml]
.allure-plugin.yml
----
id: my-plugin
name: Plugin name goes here
description: More detailed explanation of what does this plugin do.
extensions:
- my.company.allure.CustomPlugin // - Fully qualified names of classes that implement `Extension` interface and comprise data processing functionality.
- my.company.allure.CustomWidget
jsFiles:
- index.js
cssFiles:
- styles.css
----

*Adding allure-plugin-api dependency*

To be able to use the API you should simply download the `allure-plugin-api` dependency
link:https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.qameta.allure/allure-plugin-api[from] the jcenter repository.
To do so add to your project build script:

in Gradle:

[source, groovy]
----
dependencies {
    compileOnly('io.qameta.allure:allure-plugin-api:${allureVersion}')
}
----

in Maven:
[source, xml]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.qameta.allure</groupId>
            <artifactId>allure-plugin-api</artifactId>
            <version>${allureVersion}</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
----

==== Step 2: Writing a Java class that processes test results

Let's consider we have some very simple set of parameterized tests, where typical result will contain captured
arguments of test case in the `parameters` section.

[source, json]
----
{
  "uuid":"0edd28b1-3c7f-4593-8dda-db9aa004891f",
  "fullName":"io.qameta.allure.animals.AnimalsTest.angryCat",
  "name":"angryCat",
  "status":"passed",
  "stage":"finished",
  "start":1495467840415,
  "stop":1495467840416,
  "parameters":[
    {
      "name":"arg0",
      "value":"Hiss!"
    }
  ]
}
----

We are preparing to write a fully-fledged new plugin that adds a new tab with
some test results representation and creates a widget to place on Overview tab with some digested data.
For example, let's consider a plugin that extracts passed and failed parameters from this parameterized tests,
creates a new tab, and a widget where only recent failures are displayed.

We should start with writing a Java class that implements `Aggregator` and `Widget` interfaces.

[[app-listing]]
[source, java]
.MyPlugin.java
----
public class MyPlugin implements Aggregator, Widget {

    @Override
    public void aggregate(final Configuration configuration,
                          final List<LaunchResults> launches,
                          final Path outputDirectory) throws IOException {
    final JacksonContext jacksonContext = configuration
        .requireContext(JacksonContext.class);
    final Path dataFolder = Files.createDirectories(outputDirectory.resolve("data"));
    final Path dataFile = dataFolder.resolve("myplugindata.json");
    final Stream<TestResult> resultsStream = launches.stream()
        .flatMap(launch -> launch.getAllResults().stream());
    try (OutputStream os = Files.newOutputStream(dataFile)) {
        jacksonContext.getValue().writeValue(os, extractData(resultsStream));
    }
    }

    private Collection<Map> extractData(final Stream<TestResult> testResults) {
        //extraction logic
    }

    @Override
    public Object getData(Configuration configuration, List<LaunchResults> launches) {
        Stream<TestResult> filteredResults = launches.stream().flatMap(launch -> launch.getAllResults().stream())
                .filter(result -> result.getStatus().equals(Status.FAILED));
        return extractData(filteredResults);
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "mywidget";
    }
}
----

What is happening in the code above?

 . In `aggregate` method, data that is extracted from test results in the `extractData` method is written to the
  `myplugindata.json` file that is stored in the report's `data` folder. To create a proper .json file a
  `JacksonContext` is used to obtain a mapper instance. This data will be displayed on the new tab.

 . `getData` method implementation creates data to be used in the new widget, and `getName` method defines
  name of the entry for the `widgets.json` file where this data will be stored.


[[app-listing]]
[source, json]
.myplugindata.json
----
[ {
  "sounds" : [ "Growl!", "Hiss!" ],
  "name" : "angryCat"
}, {
  "sounds" : [ "Oink!", "Meow!" ],
  "name" : "hungryCat"
}, {
  "sounds" : [ "Bark!", "Woof!", "Moo!" ],
  "name" : "bigDog"
} ]
----

[[app-listing]]
[source, json]
.widgets.json
----
...
"mywidget" : [ {
    "sounds" : [ "Oink!" ],
    "name" : "hungryCat"
  }, {
    "sounds" : [ "Moo!" ],
    "name" : "bigDog"
  } ],
...
----

==== Adding an utility Context class

Your plugins may require to share some common utilities that would be wise to make available in on-demand manner.
A quick example of such an utility class would be `JacksonContext`, which can be used to obtain a mapper
 to serialize Java objects with data into the report JSON files.

[source, java]
----
public class JacksonContext implements Context<ObjectMapper> {

    private final ObjectMapper mapper;

    public JacksonContext() {
        this.mapper = new ObjectMapper()
                .configure(MapperFeature.USE_WRAPPER_NAME_AS_PROPERTY_NAME, true)
                .setAnnotationIntrospector(new JaxbAnnotationIntrospector(TypeFactory.defaultInstance()))
                .enable(SerializationFeature.INDENT_OUTPUT)
                .disable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES)
                .setSerializationInclusion(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL);
    }

    @Override
    public ObjectMapper getValue() {
        return mapper;
    }
}
----

Then, from a plugin class it can be accessed from `Configuration` instance as in the Step 2.

==== Step 3: Adding a new tab for the report

Here we switch to the front-end side of the Allure report and start with adding some JavaScript code to the `index.js`
file.

Backbone manages data with link:http://backbonejs.org/#Model[Models] or
 link:http://backbonejs.org/#Collection[Collections], on the previous step we saved the data for our page as
 a Collection<Map>, so the model for the tab should extend `Backbone.Collection`. This object will contain the data from
 the file, specified in the `url`. Then, for your new tab you need to extend a link:http://backbonejs.org/#View[View]
 class from the base `AppLayout` class that already contains report's left navigational menu.
  It is provided in the global `allure` object:

[source, javascript]
----
var MyTabModel = Backbone.Collection.extend({
    url: 'data/myplugindata.json'
})

class MyLayout extends allure.components.AppLayout {

    initialize() {
        this.model = new MyTabModel();
    }

    loadData() {
        return this.model.fetch();
    }

    getContentView() {
        return new MyView({items: this.model.models});
    }
}
----

In `MyLayout` class you can override a `getContentView` method to define some other View class that will manage the
contents of your tab. Below is some simplistic implementation of the View class, `template` is some template
function that returns html template with added data.

[source, javascript]
----
const template = function (data) {
    html = '<h3 class="pane__title">My Tab</h3>';
    for (var item of data.items) {
        html += '<p>' + item.attributes.name + ' says: ' + item.attributes.sounds + '</p>';
    }
    return html;
}

var MyView = Backbone.Marionette.View.extend({
    template: template,

    render: function () {
        this.$el.html(this.template(this.options));
        return this;
    }
})
----

After all that add `addTab` function call would look like this:

[source, javascript]
----
allure.api.addTab('mytab', {
    title: 'My Tab', icon: 'fa fa-trophy',
    route: 'mytab',
    onEnter: (function () {
        return new MyLayout()
    })
});
----

Which will finally give you a new tab:

image::plugins_add_tab_example.png[Hello world tab example]

==== Step 4: Adding a new widget on the Overview page

To create a new widget you need to implement a small View class that manages data that you put into `widgets.json` on
the step 2. Note, that if you return the data from `getData` as a collection, it will subsequently be provided to
 the widget as an array, that can be obtained as `this.model.get('items')`. In the code below `template` function
 defines the actual html to be displayed in the widget.

[[app-listing]]
[source, javascript]
.index.js
----
class MyWidget extends Backbone.Marionette.View {

    template(data) {
            return widgetTemplate(data)
    }

    serializeData() {
        return {
            items: this.model.get('items'),
        }
    }
}

allure.api.addWidget('mywidget', MyWidget);
----

This finally gives us a new widget on the Overview dashboard.

image::plugins_add_widget_example.png[A new widget on the Overview]

==== Step 5: Adding translation for strings

Returning to the tab example, it's very easy to enable translated strings in it. In templates you need
to substitute plain text strings for placeholders and use `translate` function, and also you need to register
translations via `addTranslation`.

[source, javascript]
----

const template = function (data) {
    html = '<h3 class="pane__title">' + allure.api.translate(mytab.name) + '</h3>';
    for (var item of data.items) {
        html += '<p>' + item.attributes.name + ' says: ' + item.attributes.sounds + '</p>';
    }
    return html;
}

allure.api.addTranslation('en', {
    mytab: {
        name: 'My Tab',
    }
},
});

allure.api.addTranslation('ru', {
    mytab: {
        name: 'Моя Вкладка',
    }
},
});
----

==== Step 6: Adding new sections for test case page

Internally, many Allure features are implemented using plugin api, let's see how for example links are added to the
test case page.

With `addTestcaseBlock` method you can define a View that you can assume will have a test case object as a Model
available at `this.model`.

A View class:
[[app-listing]]
[source, javascript]
.LinksView.js
----
import './styles.css';
import {View} from 'backbone.marionette';
import {className} from '../../decorators';
import template from './LinksView.hbs';

@className('pane__section')
class LinksView extends View {
    template = template;

    serializeData() {
        return {
            links: this.model.get('links')
        };
    }
}
----

Handlebars is used as a template engine:

[[app-listing]]
[source, html]
.LinksView.hbs
----
{{#if links}}
    <h3 class="pane__section-title">{{t 'testCase.links.name'}}</h3>
    {{#each links}}
        <span class="testcase-link">
        {{#if (eq type "issue")}}
            <span class="fa fa-bug"></span>
        {{/if}}
        {{#if (eq type "tms")}}
            <span class="fa fa-database"></span>
        {{/if}}
        <a class="link" href="{{this.url}}" target="_blank">{{name}}</a>
    </span>
    {{/each}}
{{/if}}
----

[[app-listing]]
[source, javascript]
.index.js
----
import LinksView from './LinksView';

allure.api.addTestcaseBlock(LinksView, {position: 'before'});
----

Which adds a links section to the test case:

image::plugins_add_testcase_block_example.png[New test case block]

==== Step 7: Plugin distribution

When you build a plugin, you should come up with the following structure, which then can be copied into `plugins` folder
of the commandline distribution.

[source]
----
\my-plugin
    allure-plugin.yml
    plugin.jar
    \lib
        dependency.jar
    \static
        styles.css
        index.js
----

 * *plugin.jar* - is a jar with your compiled plugin classes
 * *\lib* - all of your pugin's dependencies should be placed in here
 * *\static* - a folder containing all static `.js` and `.css` files.

Here is a template of gradle build script for a plugin project that uses
link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/javaLibraryDistribution_plugin.html[Java Library Distribution Plugin]
to package plugin classes and copy files and dependencies into one .zip archive.

[[app-listing]]
[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

apply plugin: 'java-library-distribution'

jar {
    archiveName = 'plugin.jar'
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly('io.qameta.allure:allure-plugin-api:2.0-BETA8')
}
----

==== Step 8: Enabling a plugin

Allure commandline distribution has a following folder structure:

[source]
----
/allure-commandline
    /bin
    /config
        allure.yml
    /lib
    /plugins
        /behaviors-plugin
        /junit-plugin
        /screen-diff-plugin
----

Here in `plugins` folder plugins distributions to use at the report generation reside. By default several plugins
are already added to the Allure. Their usage is managed by default build profile configuration file`/config/allure.yml`.
In this file, under the section `plugins` plugin folders to use are listed, so it's contents should look like this:

[[app-listing]]
[source, yml]
.allure.yml
----
plugins:
  - behaviors-plugin
  - junit-plugin
  - screen-diff-plugin
----

To enable your own plugin, copy folder with distribution to the `plugins` folder
and then add the folder's name to the corresponding build profile configuration:

[source]
----
/allure-commandline
    /bin
    /config
        allure.yml
    /lib
    /plugins
        /behaviors-plugin
        /junit-plugin
        /screen-diff-plugin
        /my-plugin
----

[[app-listing]]
[source, yml]
.allure.yml
----
plugins:
  - behaviors-plugin
  - junit-plugin
  - screen-diff-plugin
  - my-plugin
----

=== Existing plugins
Several important Allure features are implemented as decoupled plugins that are stored independently under
the `plugins` folder of Allure Commandline distribution. Their usage can be managed by build profiles functionality
(jump to the (link to the section)[Commandline configuration]).


==== Custom Logo

Let's start with studuying how one of the simplest plugins works. In this section we will quickly
examine a plugin available in the Allure distribution which allows you to change a logo picture shown in
the upper-left corner of the report.

image::plugins_custom_logo.png[Custom logo in the report]

plugin sources directory structure:

[source]
----
/src
    /dist
        allure-plugin.yml
        /static
            custom-logo.svg
            styles.css
    build.gradle
----

[[app-listing]]
[source, yml]
.allure-plugin.yml
----
id: custom-logo
name: Custom logo aggregator
description: The aggregator replaces default Allure logo with a custom one
cssFiles:
  - styles.css
----

* *custom-logo.svg* - is a vector graphics file with a logo to use
* *styles.css* - a css file that adds the style, that will override default logotype.


[[app-listing]]
[source, css]
.styles.css
----
.side-nav__brand {
  background: url('custom-logo.svg') no-repeat left center;
  margin-left: 10px;
}
----

==== Behaviors

Behaviors plugin is created to support behavior-driven approach in testing with Allure report.
Test cases should have Feature and Story labels, that plugin will aggregate and create a widget
showing statistics of stories results per every feature, and a new tab, where all test results are
grouped by their features and stories.

 - In Java-based adaptors you can mark your tests with `@Feature` and `@Story` annotations.

 - In JS-based adaptors you can use `allure.feature(featureName)` and `allure.story(storyName)` methods

 - In CucumberJVM Features and Stories are extracted exactly as the tests are organized in Features and Scenarios.

Once your tests are properly labeled, you can start using Behaviors plugin right away since it is included in
Allure distribution by default. You can find plugin sources in the
link:https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2/tree/master/plugins[plugins folder of the Allure 2 project]

Behaviors plugin structure:

[source]
----
/src
    /dist
        allure-plugin.yml
        /static
            index.js
    /main
        /java
            /io.qameta.allure.behaviors
                BehaviorsPlugin.java
    build.gradle
----

*BehavioursPlugin.java*

This plugin creates a different representation for the test results tree, that is why it's `BehaviorsPlugin` class
 inherits from a base class providing tree aggregation - `AbstractTreeAggregator` and implements a `Widget`
 interface to prepare the data for a widget on the Overview report dashboard.


 * To provide aggregation classifier, plugin should implement a method
 `List<TreeGroup> getGroups(final TestResult result)`

[source, java]
----
@Override
    protected List<TreeGroup> getGroups(final TestResult result) {
        return Arrays.asList(
                TreeGroup.allByLabel(result, LabelName.FEATURE, DEFAULT_FEATURE),
                TreeGroup.allByLabel(result, LabelName.STORY, DEFAULT_STORY)
        );
    }
----

This groups will determine a placement for every `TestResult` when building a tree of regrouped results to store in the
 `behaviors.json` file.

 * Another part of `BehaviorsPlugin` class is a `getData` method that comprises implementation of `Widget` interface.
This method prepares aggregated information on amount of passed stories per every feature,
that will be put into the `widget.json` file.

*index.js*

After that, in the `index.js` api calls for creation of a new tab and creation of a new widget are as follows:

[source, javascript]
----
allure.api.addTab('behaviors', {
    title: 'tab.behaviors.name', icon: 'fa fa-list',
    route: 'behaviors(/:testcaseId)',
    onEnter: (function () {
        var routeParams = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
        return new allure.components.TreeLayout({
            routeParams: routeParams,
            tabName: 'tab.behaviors.name',
            baseUrl: 'behaviors',
            url: 'data/behaviors.json'
        });
    })
});

allure.api.addWidget('behaviors', allure.components.WidgetStatusView.extend({
    title: 'widget.behaviors.name',
    baseUrl: 'behaviors',
    showLinks: false,
    showAllText: 'widget.behaviors.showAll'
}));
----

Note a special `TreeLayout` component that can be used for displaying all types of data, produced by
implementations of `AbstractTreeAggregator`. Also, a `route` attribute defines a pattern for links to the test case
 pages.

image::plugins_behaviors.png[Behaviors tab]

==== Junit

Junit plugin works without a front-end part, it is created to enable Allure generator to process junit report xml format
into the Allure test results, this plugin is enabled by default, so when you use `allure generate` command for a folder
with junit test results, a report will be generated.
