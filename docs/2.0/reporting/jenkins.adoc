== Configuration
=== Job configuration
. Open job configuration page.
. Ensure that your build generates some data in one of the formats digestible for Allure Commandline tool.
//link to the wiki page about data[Learn about data to build a report on]
. Add **Allure Report** post build action.
+
image::jenkins_plugin_add_allure_report.jpeg[Select "Allure Report" post-build action]
. Configure the Allure Report.
+

=== Test Management and Bug-Tracking systems integrations

Currently all versions of Allure support setting of url patterns to make direct links
to your TMS or bug-tracker available from the report. (Learn more about this integrations link-[here])
It may be done by setting special system properties:

. **allure.tests.management.pattern** property:
+
image::jenkins_plugin_setup_tms.jpeg[Filling TMS link property]

. *allure.issues.tracker.pattern* property:
+
image::jenkins_plugin_setup_tracker.jpeg[Filling bug-tracker link property]

in both patterns **%s** will be substituted for a string value obtained from the label added to test case.

=== Advanced Options

"Advanced..." button provides you with several additional settings:

 * jdk to use
 * build policy value
 * include environment flag  - *currently is not implemented*

== Usage
When build is finished a link to Allure report will appear on the build page and also in the build history entries:

image::jenkins_plugin_allure_sidebar.png[Install Allure Commanline]

Generated Allure report is stored in the artifacts folder of the build and can be processed
the same way as all the other artifacts, or downloaded as .zip archive.

== History files

Allure since version 2 supports history for tests in the report [Learn more about History plugin].
At the every report generation during the build Jenkins Allure Plugin will try to access working directory of the previous
build and copy contents of `allure-report\history` folder to the current report contents. At the moment history entry for
test case stores information about up to 5 previous results.

== Extensions

=== Job DSL Plugin
The https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki[job-dsl-plugin] allows the programmatic creation of projects using a DSL.

[source, groovy]
----
// default
publishers {
    allure(['allure-results'])
}
 
// advanced
publishers {
    allure(['first-results', 'second-results']) {
        jdk('java7')
        commandline('1.4.18')
 
        buildFor('UNSTABLE')
        includeProperties(true)
        property('allure.issues.tracker.pattern', 'http://tracker.company.com/%s')
        property('allure.tests.management.pattern', 'http://tms.company.com/%s')
    }
}
----

=== Pipeline Plugin

To add Allure report generation from pipeline steps one can use Pipeline Syntax builder
to generate Allure step code. Note, that `commandline` parameter points to Allure Commandline
installation name to use, if it is not provided, plugin will pick first suitable installation found automatically.

image::jenkins_plugin_pipeline_step_builder.png[Pipeline step generation]

which gives a pipeline script:

[source, groovy]
----
node {
// script body

allure([
         includeProperties: false,
         jdk: '',
         properties: [[key: 'allure.issues.tracker.pattern', value: 'http://tracker.company.com/%s']],
         reportBuildPolicy: 'ALWAYS',
         results: [[path: 'target/allure-results'], [path: 'other_target/allure-results']]
         ])
}
----

To use Allure Report from the pipeline steps one can invoke Allure DSL method as script:

[source, groovy]
----

stage('reports') {
    steps {
    script {
            allure([
                    includeProperties: false,
                    jdk: '',
                    properties: [],
                    reportBuildPolicy: 'ALWAYS',
                    results: [[path: 'target/allure-results']]
            ])
    }
    }
}
