== Installation
. Install https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/UPM/Installing+add-ons[Allure Plugin] from "Plugin Manager Page".
. You can either:
.. download the latest version of allure-commandline.zip from github and extract it on your Bamboo server
.. or allow Bamboo plugin to download Allure binary automatically for you.
. Allure Bamboo Plugin will add the new executable server capability upon the installation. However you may decide to
change the Allure version or to have multiple versions of Allure executable.
+
To https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/defining-a-new-executable-capability-289277164.html[define a new executable
capability] with using the extraction directory, you need to open "Executables" admin menu item and then select "add an
executable as a server capability" link in the description. You need to select "Allure Report" as a capability type.

+
Executable label defines the version of Allure executable, that will be downloaded automatically. Version should be set
at the end of the label name (e.g. "Allure 2.3.1" or "allure 2.4-BETA1").

== Configuration
. Open "Allure Report" administration menu item under "PLANS" group.
+
image::bamboo_admin_allure_report.png[Allure Report Config]
. Configure "Allure local storage" if necessary. This defines a directory where built Allure reports will be stored.
+
**Please note** that Allure Bamboo Plugin stores reports on a same filesystem where Bamboo server is running, and
it does not clean the directory automatically. So you might need to configure the removal of the old reports manually.
. You may decide to enable Allure Bamboo Plugin for all of your builds. In this case it will be trying to build a
report for every failed build in your Bamboo instance by default. You can always turn it off/on for each particular
plan later:
+

. Ensure that your build https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-core/wiki#gathering-information-about-tests)[generates Allure result files].
. Also you should configure the Allure artifacts to be collected by each job. Just add the following artifact definition to the job:

. For each correctly configured plan you should be able to see the "Allure Report" tab in the results:

== Storing Allure reports in AWS S3
You may decide to store your artifacts and also Allure reports in Amazon S3 storage, which isn't available in Bamboo by
default. However you can enable this feature by adding "-Dbamboo.darkfeature.artifacthandlers=true" to the command line
that you use to start up Bamboo instance. This will give you the ability to configure artifact handlers using
"Artifact handlers" admin menu item and allow to configure AWS S3 as a primary storage for all of your artifacts
(including built Allure reports).

[WARNING]
====
"Artifact handlers" dark feature is not officially supported by Atlassian, so you'd be using it on your own risk.
====

== Troubleshooting
=== No artifacts configured
If you haven't configured Allure artifacts correctly or a build does not generate allure results, you should see the
following error:

image::bamboo_no_artifacts.png[Allure no artifacts]

=== Empty report tab
If a report has been generated successfully, but later has been removed, you should see the empty report tab.

=== Unknown error
If something went wrong during the Allure report generation, you should see the exception in the Allure tab. This is
the important information if you decide to raise an issue in allure-bamboo issue tracker:
