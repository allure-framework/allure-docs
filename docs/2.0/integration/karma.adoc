== API
With allure reporter you get some functions for provide additional info about tests.
All functions available as methods of the global `allure` object.

* `description(description)` assign a description to current testcase
* `severity(severity)` assign a severity to current testcase. Possible values enumerated as properties,
 eg. `allure.severity.BLOCKER`. All securities by descending of their importance:

  - BLOCKER
  - CRITICAL
  - NORMAL
  - MINOR
  - TRIVIAL
* `createStep(name, stepFunction)` defines test step. Returns wrapped function which reports about every step calling.
 Step function can be nested within one another.
 It is most powerful feature of allure, because it allow to write self-documented tests which report about every its step.
