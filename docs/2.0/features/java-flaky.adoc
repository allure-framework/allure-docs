= Flaky tests

In real life not all of your tests are stable and always green or always red.  A test might start to "blink" i.e. it fails from time-to-time without any obvious reason.
You could disable such a test, that is a trivial solution. However what if you do not want to do that?
Say you would like to get more details on possible reasons or the test is so critical that even being flaky it provides helpful information?
You have an option now to mark such tests in a special way, so the resulting report will clearly show them as unstable:

[source, java]
----
@Flaky
public void aTestWhichFailsFromTimeToTime {
     ...
}
----

Here is what you get in the report if such a test failed:

NOTE: you can mark a whole test class as flaky as well.
