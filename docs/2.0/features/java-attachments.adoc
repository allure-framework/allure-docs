An attachment in Java code is simply a method annotated with *@Attachment* that returns either
a **String** or **byte[]**, which should be added to the report:

[source, java, linenums]
----
import io.qameta.allure.Attachment;

...

@Attachment
public String performedActions(ActionSequence actionSequence) {
    return actionSequence.toString();
}

@Attachment(value = "Page screenshot", type = "image/png")
public byte[] saveScreenshot(byte[] screenShot) {
    return screenShot;
}
----

Or you can use Allure helper methods

[source, java, linenums]
----
import io.qameta.allure.Allure;

...

Allure.addAttachment("My attachment", "My attachment content");

Path content = Paths.get("path-to-my-attachment-contnet");
try (InputSteam is = Files.newInputStream(content)) {
    Allure.addAttachemnt("My attachment", is);
}
----


NOTE: If return type in a method annotated with *@Attachment* differs from *String* or *byte[]* we call *toString()*
on return value to get attachment contents.

You can specify exact MIME type for each attached file using *type* parameter of *@Attachment* annotation
like shown above. However there's no need to explicitly specify attachment type for all attached files as Allure
by default analyses attachment contents and can determine attachment type automatically. You usually need to
specify attachment type when working with plain text files.
