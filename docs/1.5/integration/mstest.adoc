= MSTest
**MSTestAllureAdapter** allows you convert an MSTest trx file to the XMLs from which an Allure report can be generated.

Because MSTest does not have an extension or hook mechanism this adapter cannot run as part of MSTest but instead it converts the resulting trx file to the xml format expected by allure.

It is a .NET/Mono based console application.

== Usage
[source, bash]
----
MSTestAllureAdapter.Console.exe <TRX file> [output target dir]
----

If '[output target dir]' is missing the reslts are saved in the current directory in a folder named 'results'.

[source, bash]
----
$ mono MSTestAllureAdapter.Console.exe sample.trx 
----

This will generate the xml files from which the allure report can be created based upon the 'sample.trx' file.

[source, bash]
----
$ mono MSTestAllureAdapter.Console.exe sample.trx output-xmls
----

This will generate the xml files from which the allure report can be created in a folder named 'output-xmls' based upon the 'sample.trx' file.

If the target directory does not exists it is created.

To generate a report using https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-cli/releases/tag/allure-cli-2.1[allure-cli]:
[source, bash]
----
$ allure generate output-xmls -v 1.4.0
----
