= Jasmine
A plugin for Allure report generation from Jasmine tests.

== Installation

=== From Jasmine2
Add the lib into `package.json` and then configure the plugin:

[source, javascript]
----
// conf.js
var AllureReporter = require('jasmine-allure-reporter');
jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new AllureReporter({
  resultsDir: 'allure-results'
}));
----

=== From Protractor
Put the above code into the `onPrepare` inside of your `conf.js`:

[source, javascript]
----
// conf.js
exports.config = {
  framework: 'jasmine2',
  onPrepare: function() {
    var AllureReporter = require('jasmine-allure-reporter');
    jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new AllureReporter({
      resultsDir: 'allure-results'
    }));
  }
}
----

== Generate HTML report from Allure results
The Reporter will generate xml files inside of a `resultsDir`, then we need to generate HTML out of them.
You can use Maven for that. Copy ready-to-use `pom.xml` from `node_modules/jasmine-allure-reporter` and run:

`mvn site -Dallure.results_pattern=allure-results`

It will put HTMLs into `target/site/allure-maven-plugin` folder. To serve them via `localhost:1324` use:

`mvn jetty:run -Djetty.port=1234`

Otherwise choose one of the
https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-core/wiki#generating-a-report[other ways to generate HTML].

== Features
This adapter provides a set of methods that can be called from the global `Jasmine2AllureReporter` object.
It wraps https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-js-commons[common allure JS adapter] and provides access
to basic Allure features implemented there.

=== Title
WARNING: TBD it is not implemented currently

=== Description
In order to add a detailed description for a test you should call a `setDescription(description)` method
where *description* is your string argument.

WARNING: code snippet TBD

=== Severity
You can specify a severity attribute for a test via `severity(severity)` method where
*severity* argument can hold one of the following pre-defined values:

* BLOCKER
* CRITICAL
* NORMAL
* MINOR
* TRIVIAL

WARNING: code snippet TBD

=== Behaviours
In some development approaches tests are classified by
https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-core/wiki/Glossary#user-story[stories] and
https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-core/wiki/Glossary#feature[features].
If you’re using this, then for each test you can set story and feature attributes via `story(story)` and
`feature(feature)` methods respectively, accepting *story* or *feature* as a string argument.

WARNING: code snippet TBD

=== Steps
Steps are needed to specify actions that constitute a testing scenario.
Steps are named, they can create attachments and can be used in different testing scenarios.
You can add a step via `createStep(name, stepFunc)` method, where

* *name* is a string arg bearing step name
* *stepFunc* is a wrapped function whose logic this step represents in the report.

WARNING: code snippet TBD

=== Attachments
You can add an attachment for one of the steps via `createAttachment(name, content, type)` method
here

* *name* is a string bearing attachment's description
* *content* is either a function, returning attachment object or the attachment object itself.
* *type* is a string parameter to specify exact MIME type for each attached file. However there’s no need to
specify attachment explicitly type for all attached files as Allure by default analyses attachment contents and
can determine attachment type automatically. You usually need to specify attachment type when working with plain
text files.

Example: adding a screenshot in the end of each test

[source, javascript]
----
  onPrepare: function () {
    var AllureReporter = require('jasmine-allure-reporter');
    jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new AllureReporter());
    jasmine.getEnv().afterEach(function(done){
      browser.takeScreenshot().then(function (png) {
        allure.createAttachment('Screenshot', function () {
          return new Buffer(png, 'base64')
        }, 'image/png')();
        done();
      })
    });
  }
----
Note `done` callback!

=== Issues Tracker
WARNING: Integration with bug tracker system is not currently implemented

=== Test Management System
WARNING: Integration with test management system is not currently implemented

=== Parameters
In order to add information about test method
https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-core/wiki/Glossary#parameter[parameters] you should use one of the methods:

. `addArgument(name, value)` - to specify more information on one of the test arguments
. `addEnvironment(name, value)` - to specify more information on some of the environment variables

WARNING: code snippet TBD

== TBD
* Currently attachments are added to the test case instead of the current step. This needs to be fixed in allure-js-commons.
* Add support for Features.
* Add support to Jasmine1. Right now only Jasmine2 is available (do we really need this?).
* Add ability to use reflection for decoration method of page objects so that we don't need to write
 Allure-related boilerplate tying ourselves to one specific reporter.

== For Developers
See the https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-jasmine-plugin/blob/master/test/system[system tests]
to quickly check how the reporter works in real life:

`node_modules/protractor/bin/protractor ./test/system/conf.js`
