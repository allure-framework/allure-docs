= Pytest

== Installation
Pytest is available for installation from the https://pypi.python.org/pypi/allure-pytest[PyPI], therefore
installation with pip is recommended. To install the latest version, execute from the command line:

[source, bash]
----
$ pip install allure-pytest
----

That will install allure-pytest and allure-python-commons packages to produce report data compatible with Allure 2.
If you are using a previous version of adapter for the
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-allure-adaptor[first generation] of Allure reports then you will need to
uninstall it first.

== Usage
To enable Allure listener to collect results during the test execution simply add `--alluredir` option and
provide path to the folder where results should be stored. E.g.:

[source, bash]
----
$ pytest --alluredir=/tmp/my_allure_results
----

To see the actual report after your tests have finished, you need to use Allure commandline utility to generate report
 from the results.

[source, bash]
----
$ allure serve /tmp/my_allure_results
----

This command will show you generated report in your default browser.

== Basic Reporting

Your can see all default pytest statuses in the Allure report: only tests that were not succeeded due to one of the
assertion errors will be marked as failed, any other exception will cause a test to have a broken status.

[source, python]
----
import pytest

def test_success():
    """this test succeeds"""
    assert True


def test_failure():
    """this test fails"""
    assert False


def test_skip():
    """this test is skipped"""
    pytest.skip('for a reason!')


def test_broken():
    raise Exception('oops')
----

== Supported Pytest features

Some of the common Pytest features that the Allure report supports include xfails, fixtures and
finalizers, marks, conditional skips and parametrization.

=== Xfail

This is pytest way of marking expected failures: (https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/skipping.html[Pytest docs])

[source, python]
----
@pytest.mark.xfail(condition=lambda: True, reason='this test is expecting failure')
def test_xfail_expected_failure():
    """this test is an xfail that will be marked as expected failure"""
    assert False


@pytest.mark.xfail(condition=lambda: True, reason='this test is expecting failure')
def test_xfail_unexpected_pass():
    """this test is an xfail that will be marked as unexpected success"""
    assert True
----

Which results in test being skipped and marked with a special tag when it is expected to fail.

image::pytest_xpass_expected_failure.png["Expected xpass failure"]

And special marking in description and a special tag when it unexpectedly passed.

image::pytest_xpass_unexpected_pass.png["Unexpected xpass pass"]

=== Conditional mark

In Pytest you can conditionally mark a test to not be executed under some specific conditions
 (https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/skipping.html[Pytest docs]):

[source, python]
----
@pytest.mark.skipif('2 + 2 != 5', reason='This test is skipped by a triggered condition in @pytest.mark.skipif')
def test_skip_by_triggered_condition():
    pass
----

When condition is evaluated to true, test receives a 'Skipped' status in report, a tag and a description from the
decorator.

image::pytest_conditional_skip.png["Conditional skip triggered"]

=== Fixtures and Finalizers

Fixtures and finalizers are the utility functions that will be invoked by Pytest before your test starts and after your
test ends respectively. Allure tracks invocations of every fixture and shows in full details what methods with what
arguments were invoked, preserving the correct sequence of the calls that were made.
 (https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#id30[Pytest docs])

You don't need to mark your fixtures to make them visible in the report, they will be detected automatically for
different skopes.

[source, python]
----
@pytest.fixture(params=[True, False], ids=['param_true', 'param_false'])
def function_scope_fixture_with_finalizer(request):
    if request.param:
        print('True')
    else:
        print('False')
    def function_scope_finalizer():
        function_scope_step()
    request.addfinalizer(function_scope_finalizer)


@pytest.fixture(scope='class')
def class_scope_fixture_with_finalizer(request):
    def class_finalizer_fixture():
        class_scope_step()
    request.addfinalizer(class_finalizer_fixture)


@pytest.fixture(scope='module')
def module_scope_fixture_with_finalizer(request):
    def module_finalizer_fixture():
        module_scope_step()
    request.addfinalizer(module_finalizer_fixture)


@pytest.fixture(scope='session')
def session_scope_fixture_with_finalizer(request):
    def session_finalizer_fixture():
        session_scope_step()
    request.addfinalizer(session_finalizer_fixture)


class TestClass(object):

    def test_with_scoped_finalizers(self,
                                    function_scope_fixture_with_finalizer,
                                    class_scope_fixture_with_finalizer,
                                    module_scope_fixture_with_finalizer,
                                    session_scope_fixture_with_finalizer):
        step_inside_test_body()
----

image::pytest_skoped_finalizers.png["Test with fixtures and finalizers executed within different scopes."]

Depending on an outcome of a fixture execution, test that is dependent on it may receive a different status.
Exception in the fixture would make all dependent tests broken, `pytest.skip()` call would make all dependent test
skipped.

[source, python]
----
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def skip_fixture():
    pytest.skip()


@pytest.fixture
def fail_fixture():
    assert False


@pytest.fixture
def broken_fixture():
    raise Exception("Sorry, it's broken.")


def test_with_pytest_skip_in_the_fixture(skip_fixture):
    pass


def test_with_failure_in_the_fixture(fail_fixture):
    pass


def test_with_broken_fixture(broken_fixture):
    pass
----

image::pytest_fixture_effect.png["Fixture execution outcome resulting in different statuses."]

=== Parametrization

You can generate many test cases from the sets of input parameters using `@pytest.mark.parametrize`.
 (https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/skipping.html[Pytest docs])

All argument names and values will be captured in the report, optionally argument names will be replaced with
provided string descriptions in the `ids` kwarg.

[source, python]
----
import allure
import pytest


@allure.step
def simple_step(step_param1, step_param2 = None):
    pass


@pytest.mark.parametrize('param1', [True, False], ids=['id explaining value 1', 'id explaining value 2'])
def test_parameterize_with_id(param1):
    simple_step(param1)


@pytest.mark.parametrize('param1', [True, False])
@pytest.mark.parametrize('param2', ['value 1', 'value 2'])
def test_parametrize_with_two_parameters(param1, param2):
    simple_step(param1, param2)


@pytest.mark.parametrize('param1', [True], ids=['boolean parameter id'])
@pytest.mark.parametrize('param2', ['value 1', 'value 2'])
@pytest.mark.parametrize('param3', [1])
def test_parameterize_with_uneven_value_sets(param1, param2, param3):
    simple_step(param1, param3)
    simple_step(param2)
----

== Allure Features

Allure currently supports almost every available feature except for environment with Pytest.

=== Steps

The first and probably most important aspect of the Allure report is that it allows to get a very detailed step-by-step
representation of every test invocation. This is made possible with `@allure.step` decorator that adds invocation
of the annotated method or function with provided arguments to the report.

Methods annotated with `@step` can be stored aside from your tests and just imported when needed. Step methods can
have an arbitrarily deep nested structure.

[source, python]
----
import allure
import pytest

from .steps import imported_step


@allure.step
def passing_step():
    pass


@allure.step
def step_with_nested_steps():
    nested_step()


@allure.step
def nested_step():
    nested_step_with_arguments(1, 'abc')


@allure.step
def nested_step_with_arguments(arg1, arg2):
    pass


def test_with_imported_step():
    passing_step()
    imported_step()


def test_with_nested_steps():
    passing_step()
    step_with_nested_steps()
----

Status of every step is shown in a small icon on the right from the name. Nested steps are organized in a tree-like
collapsible structure.

image::pytest_nested_steps_and_args.png["Nested steps and steps with arguments."]

Steps can have a description line that supports placeholders for passed positional and keyword arguments. Default
parameters of the keyword arguments will be captured as well.

[source, python]
----
import allure

@allure.step('Step with placeholders in the title, positional: "{0}", keyword: "{key}"')
def step_with_title_placeholders(arg1, key=None):
    pass


def test_steps_with_placeholders():
    step_with_title_placeholders(1, key='something')
    step_with_title_placeholders(2)
    step_with_title_placeholders(3, 'anything')
----

image::pytest_step_arguments.png["Nested steps and steps with arguments."]

Steps are supported in fixtures as well. Here is an example of a test using a fixture defined in `conftest.py` module
(such fixtures will be resolved by Pytest even when not directly imported):

[source, python]
.conftest.py
----
import allure
import pytest


@allure.step('step in conftest.py')
def conftest_step():
    pass


@pytest.fixture
def fixture_with_conftest_step():
    conftest_step()
----

[source, python]
----
import allure

from .steps import imported_step


@allure.step
def passing_step():
    pass


def test_with_step_in_fixture_from_conftest(fixture_with_conftest_step):
    passing_step()
----

Steps in fixtures are shown in separate trees for setup and teardown.

image::pytest_step_in_fixture.png["Step in fixture resolved from conftest.py."]

=== Attachments

Reports can display many different types of provided attachments that can complement a test, step or fixture
result. Attachments can be created either with invocation of `allure.attach(body, name, attachment_type, extension)`:

. `body` - raw content to be written into the file.
. `name` - a string with name of the file
. `attachment_type` - one of the `allure.attachment_type` values
. `extension` - is provided will be used as an extension for the created file.

or `allure.attach.file(source, name, attachment_type, extension)`:

. `source` - a string containing path to the file.

(other arguments are the same)

[source, python]
----
import allure
import pytest


@pytest.fixture
def attach_file_in_module_scope_fixture_with_finalizer(request):
    allure.attach('A text attacment in module scope fixture', 'blah blah blah', allure.attachment_type.TEXT)
    def finalizer_module_scope_fixture():
        allure.attach('A text attacment in module scope finalizer', 'blah blah blah blah',
                      allure.attachment_type.TEXT)
    request.addfinalizer(finalizer_module_scope_fixture)


def test_with_attacments_in_fixture_and_finalizer(attach_file_in_module_scope_finalizer):
    pass


def test_multiple_attachments():
    allure.attach.file('./data/totally_open_source_kitten.png', attachment_type=allure.attachment_type.PNG)
    allure.attach('<head></head><body> a page </body>', 'Attach with HTML type', allure.attachment_type.HTML)
----

Attachments are shown in the context of a test entity they belong to. Attachments of HTML type are rendered and
displayed on the report page. This is a convenient way to provide some customization for your own representation
of a test result.

image::pytest_attachments.png["Attachments in the test body."]

=== Descriptions

You can add a detailed description for tests to provide as much context to the report reader as you want.
This can be done in several ways: you can add a `@allure.description` decorator providing a description string or
you can use `@allure.description_html` to provide some HTML to be rendered in the 'Description' section of a test case.
Alternatively description will be simply picked up from the docstring of a test method.

[source, python]
----
import allure

@allure.description_html("""
<h1>Test with some complicated html description</h1>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr align="center">
    <td>William</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="center">
    <td>Vasya</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>
""")
def test_html_description():
    assert True


@allure.description("""
Multiline test description.
That comes from the allure.description decorator.

Nothing special about it.
""")
def test_description_from_decorator():
    assert 42 == int(6 * 7)


def test_unicode_in_docstring_description():
    """Unicode in description.

    Этот тест проверяет юникод.

    你好伙计.
    """
    assert 42 == int(6 * 7)
----

Description supports unicode strings:

image::pytest_unicode_description_docstr.png["Description from docstring."]

Rendered HTML from `description_html`:

image::pytest_html_description.png["Description from html."]

Also descriptions can be dynamically updated from within test body using `allure.dynamic.description`.

[source, python]
----
import allure

@allure.description("""
This description will be replaced at the end of the test.
""")
def test_dynamic_description():
    assert 42 == int(6 * 7)
    allure.dynamic.description('A final description.')
----

=== Titles

Test titles can be made more readable with special `@allure.title` decorator. Titles support placeholders for arguments
 and support dynamic replacement.

[source, python]
----
import allure
import pytest


@allure.title("This test has a custom title")
def test_with_a_title():
    assert 2 + 2 == 4


@allure.title("This test has a custom title with unicode: Привет!")
def test_with_unicode_title():
    assert 3 + 3 == 6


@allure.title("Parameterized test title: adding {param1} with {param2}")
@pytest.mark.parametrize('param1,param2,expected', [
    (2, 2, 4),
    (1, 2, 5)
])
def test_with_parameterized_title(param1, param2, expected):
    assert param1 + param2 == expected


@allure.title("This title will be replaced in a test body")
def test_with_dynamic_title():
    assert 2 + 2 == 4
    allure.dynamic.title('After a successful test finish, the title was replaced with this line.')
----

image::pytest_titles.png["Description from docstring."]


=== Links

To integrate report with a bugtracker or test management system Allure has `@allure.link`, `@allure.issue` and
`@allure.testcase` descriptors.

[source, python]
----
import allure

TEST_CASE_LINK = 'https://github.com/qameta/allure-integrations/issues/8#issuecomment-268313637'


@allure.link('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YYzUTYZRMU')
def test_with_link():
    pass


@allure.link('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su5p2TqZxKU', name='Click me')
def test_with_named_link():
    pass


@allure.issue('140', 'Pytest-flaky test retries shows like test steps')
def test_with_issue_link():
    pass


@allure.testcase(TEST_CASE_LINK, 'Test case title')
def test_with_testcase_link():
    pass
----

`@allure.link` will provide a clickable link to provided url in 'Links' section:

image::pytest_test_with_link.png["Description from docstring."]

`@allure.issue` will provide a link with a small bug icon. This descriptor takes test case id as the input
parameter to use it with provided link template for issue link type. Link templates are specified in
 `--allure-link-pattern` configuration option for Pytest. Link templates and types have to be specified using a colon:

[source, bash]
----
$ pytest directory_with_tests/ --alluredir=/tmp/my_allure_report \
 --allure-link-pattern=issue:http://www.mytesttracker.com/issue/{}

----

Template keywords are `issue`, `link` and `test_case` to provide a template for the corresponding type of link.

image::pytest_test_case_with_issue_link.png["Test with a link of issue type."]
