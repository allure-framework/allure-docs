## Overview tab

The first thing we see after loading the Allure report is the overview tab.

Here you will find general information about the test results, for which the report is built.

![Overview](../images/replace_it-overview.png)

1. Summary - overall report statistics.
2. Suites - shows tests grouped by suites existing in the project.
3. [Environment](../../gettingstarted_2/features_2#environment) - information about tests environment.
4. Behaviors - information about results aggregated according to epics, features and stories.
5. [History Trend](../overview/widgets) - if tests accumulated some historical data, it‚Äôs trend will be calculated and shown on the graph.
6. Categories - common information of defects.
7. [Executors](../../gettingstarted_2/quickstart_2#test-execution) - information about how results was appeared.

Overview page's widgets are draggable and configurable. Allure Report supports its own plugin system, so different widget layouts are possible.

Collapsible navigation bar contains tabs with more detailed description of the test results, see below.
