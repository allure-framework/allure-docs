## Installation

1.  Install [Allure Plugin](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/UPM/Installing+add-ons)
    from "Plugin Manager Page".

2.  You can either:

    1.  download the latest version of allure-commandline.zip from
        github and extract it on your Bamboo server

    2.  or allow Bamboo plugin to download Allure binary automatically
        for you.

3.  Allure Bamboo Plugin will add the new executable server capability
    upon the installation. However you may decide to change the Allure
    version or to have multiple versions of Allure executable.

    To [define a new executable capability](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/defining-a-new-executable-capability-289277164.html)
    with using the extraction directory, you need to open "Executables"
    admin menu item and then select "add an executable as a server
    capability" link in the description. You need to select "Allure
    Report" as a capability type.

    ![Add capability](../images/bamboo_add_capability.png)

    Executable label defines the version of Allure executable, that will
    be downloaded automatically. Version should be set at the end of the
    label name (e.g. "Allure 2.3.1" or "allure 2.4-BETA1").

## Configuration

1.  Open "Allure Report" administration menu item under "PLANS" group.

    ![Allure Report Config](../images/bamboo_admin_allure_report.png)

2.  Configure "Allure local storage" if necessary. This defines a
    directory where built Allure reports will be stored.

    **Please note** that Allure Bamboo Plugin stores reports on a same
    filesystem where Bamboo server is running, and it does not clean the
    directory automatically. So you might need to configure the removal
    of the old reports manually.

3.  You may decide to enable Allure Bamboo Plugin for all of your
    builds. In this case it will be trying to build a report for every
    failed build in your Bamboo instance by default. You can always turn
    it off/on for each particular plan later:

    ![Plan configuration](../../images/bamboo_plan_configuration.png)

4.  You can select different versions of Allure executable on per-plan
    basis. You may decide to build reports for the failed builds only
    (by checking the respective checkbox).

5.  If your build plan produces many different types of the artifacts,
    you may want to select the specific name of the artifact with the
    Allure results, which Allure Bamboo plugin will use (by typing it in
    "Artifact name to use" textbox). The most common name for this is
    "allure-results".

6.  Ensure that your build [generates Allure result files](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-core/wiki#gathering-information-about-tests)).

7.  Also you should configure the Allure artifacts to be collected by
    each job. Just add the following artifact definition to the job:

    ![Allure Artifacts Definition](../images/bamboo_artifacts_definition.png)

8.  For each correctly configured plan you should be able to see the
    "Allure Report" tab in the results:

    ![Allure Report Tab](../images/bamboo_allure_tab.png)

### Storing Allure reports in AWS S3

You may decide to store your artifacts and also Allure reports in Amazon
S3 storage, which isn’t available in Bamboo by default. However you can
enable this feature by adding
"-Dbamboo.darkfeature.artifacthandlers=true" to the command line that
you use to start up Bamboo instance. This will give you the ability to
configure artifact handlers using "Artifact handlers" admin menu item
and allow to configure AWS S3 as a primary storage for all of your
artifacts (including built Allure reports).

"Artifact handlers" dark feature is not officially supported by
Atlassian, so you’d be using it on your own risk.

## Troubleshooting

### No artifacts configured

If you haven’t configured Allure artifacts correctly or a build does not
generate allure results, you should see the following error:

![Allure no artifacts](../images/bamboo_no_artifacts.png)

### Empty report tab

If a report has been generated successfully, but later has been removed,
you should see the empty report tab.

### Unknown error

If something went wrong during the Allure report generation, you should
see the exception in the Allure tab. This is the important information
if you decide to raise an issue in allure-bamboo issue tracker:

![Allure unknown error](../images/bamboo_unknown_error.png)
